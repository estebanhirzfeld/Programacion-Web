        <h3>2005–2007: It's About Time</h3>
        <p>
          In 2005, Joe, Kevin and Nick recorded "Please Be Mine", their first
          song recorded.[13] Upon hearing the song, the Columbia Records
          president Steve Greenberg decided to sign the brothers as a group.[14]
          They considered naming their group "Sons of Jonas" before settling on
          the name Jonas Brothers.[15] While working on their debut studio
          album, the band toured throughout 2005 with artists such as Jump5,
          Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click
          Five among others

          After being without a label for a short time, the Jonas Brothers
          signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007.[22] Around the same
          time, the brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle
          Pops, singing the jingle.[23] On March 24, two additional songs on two
          different albums were released: "Kids of the Future", from the Meet
          the Robinsons soundtrack[24] (spoof of Kim Wilde's "Kids in America"),
          and "I Wanna Be Like You", from Disneymania 5.[25] The Jonas Brothers
          made their first appearance at the White House on Monday, April 9,
          2007, during the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, where they sang
          the National Anthem.
