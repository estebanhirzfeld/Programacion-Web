        <li>
          Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a high-school chemistry teacher who,
          shortly after his 50th birthday, is diagnosed with Stage III lung
          cancer and turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As
          his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation
          under the alias of "Heisenberg".

        <li>
          Anna Gunn as Skyler White, Walter's wife who was pregnant with their
          second child before his diagnosis and who becomes increasingly
          suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.
          Gunn sees Skyler as "grounded, tough, smart and driven". Gunn sees
          Skyler's stalled writing career as her biggest dream, saying, "I think
          she really deep down yearns to be an artist and to be creative and
          productive.

        <li>
          Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Walter's cooking partner and former
          student. Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. "He's just this lost soul – I
          don't think he's a bad kid, he just got mixed in the wrong crowd."
          Paul elaborated on the character's background, saying, "He doesn't
          come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But maybe he just didn't
          relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper
          for Jesse." Paul compared the character's relationship with Walt to
          The Odd Couple

          Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, Marie's husband, Walter and Skyler's
          brother-in-law and a DEA agent. At the beginning of the series, Hank
          was intended to be the "comic relief".

          Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, Skyler's sister and Hank's
          kleptomaniac wife. Brandt described Marie as "an unpleasant bitch",
          but also stated that there was more to her than that. "I think we're
          seeing more of it now that she would be there for her family. But it's
          all about her."

          RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr., Walter and Skyler's son, who has
          cerebral palsy. He begins lashing out after Walter's cancer
          announcement. Mitte himself has cerebral palsy, although his is a
          milder form.[15] Mitte stated that he had to regress from his therapy
          to portray the character, staying up late into the night to slur his
          speech and learning to walk on crutches so that his walking would not
          look fake.

          2), a Chilean high-level drug distributor who has a cover as an owner
          of the fast-food chain Los Pollos Hermanos. Esposito stated that for
          the third season, he incorporated his yoga training in his
          performance.
