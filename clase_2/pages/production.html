        <h2>Production</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Conception</h3>
          <p>
            Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who had spent several years
            writing the Fox series The X-Files. Gilligan wanted to create a series
            in which the protagonist became the antagonist. "Television is
            historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so
            that shows can go on for years or even decades", he said. "When I
            realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show
            in which the fundamental drive is toward change?"[20] He added that his
            goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into
            Scarface.[21][22][23] Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full
            drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television
            show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other
            powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and
            acting.

            <h3>Development history</h3>
            <p>The network ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot), but the 2007â€“08 Writers Guild of America strike limited the production to seven episodes, as well as delaying the start of production for the second season.[30] Within the original nine-episode arc, Gilligan had planned to kill off Jesse or Hank, as a "ballsy" moment to end the season on.[24] This death was eliminated with the limited episode count, which Gilligan found to be a net positive given the strength of acting that both Paul and Norris brought to these roles through the seasons.</p>

            <h3>Casting</h3>
            <p>Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in the "Drive" episode of the science fiction television series The X-Files, on which Gilligan worked as a writer. Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that "Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it."[43][45] AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character Hal on the comedy series Malcolm in the Middle, approached actors John Cusack and Matthew Broderick about the role.[46] When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his X-Files episode.[47]</p>

            <h3>Scientific accuracy</h3>
            <p>Donna Nelson, a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Oklahoma, checked scripts and provided dialogue. She also drew chemical structures and wrote chemical equations which were used as props. According to creator Vince Gilligan,

              Dr. Donna Nelson from the University of Oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said, "I really like this show, and if you ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand." She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, electrical engineering, or physics. We try to get everything correct. There's no full-time [advisor] on set, but we run certain scenes by these experts first.[52]
              
              "Because Walter White was talking to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-God chemists", says Gilligan. According to Gilligan, Nelson "vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date. We also have a chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us."[53] Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right, saying that Gilligan "said it made a difference to him".</p>
