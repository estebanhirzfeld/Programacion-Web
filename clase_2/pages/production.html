        Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who had spent several years
        writing the Fox series The X-Files. Gilligan wanted to create a series
        in which the protagonist became the antagonist. "Television is
        historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so
        that shows can go on for years or even decades", he said. "When I
        realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show
        in which the fundamental drive is toward change?"[20] He added that his
        goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into
        Scarface.[21][22][23] Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full
        drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television
        show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other
        powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and
        acting.
