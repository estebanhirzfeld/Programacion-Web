      <h2>Premise</h2>
      <p>
        The show takes place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and
        2010.[9] Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a struggling, frustrated
        high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless kingpin in
        the local methamphetamine drug trade, driven to provide for his family
        financially after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Initially
        making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman
        in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger
        batches of an extremely pure, blue meth which creates high demand.
        Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of
        his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at odds
        with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his
        brother-in-law Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug
        cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his
        family's lives at risk.
